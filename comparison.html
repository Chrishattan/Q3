				<li>HTML can only be used for web design. However, it is better at it than python. This makes HTML a very specific laguage. This can make HTML very tedious and frustrating to use. <img src="images/webdesign.png" alt="web design stylized font"></li>
				<li>HTML extremly strict about order of code. This means that declarations must be put in the order they need to appear.  <img src="images/order.png" alt=" 'keep calm and order now' "></li>

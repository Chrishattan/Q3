		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>My name is Chritopher. I was born in Clearwater, Florida on Febuary 11th 2003. I have 1 sister and no brothers. I taught myself python which ignited my passion for computer programming. My intrests include; programing, reading, and playing video games.</p>

		<h2>Me in 5 years</h2>
		<p>In 5 Years I see myself fresh out of college at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="blank"> Georgia Tech</a>. After I graduate I will go to work for the US Governemnt for 4 years in order for them to pay off my college. I'll probably be renting a house that is close to my job. I would like to live in <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/" target="blank">Colorodo</a>, however my job may restrict me.</p>
		<h2>Me in 10 years</h2>
		<p>In 10 years I see myself right at the end of my tenure for the government. Once that is over I might transfer to the private sector or remain with the Government. I by this point hopefully I would have saved enough money to buy myself a small house. By this point I Should be able to move to Colorodo if I haven't yet. </p>
